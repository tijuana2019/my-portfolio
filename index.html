        <p>Hi, welcome to my portfolio. My name is Jo and I'm currently learning HTML as part of a Software Development course.
            I work as a Learning and Development Facilitator for an Insurance company in Manchester.</p>

            <p>I love travelling and try to get away as often as I can. Earlier this year I spent 5 weeks in Australia and New Zealand
                and next year I'm planning to spend 3 weeks travelling around the USA. I also like learning other languages, reading and I
                love a good horror movie. Oh and I couldn't live without craft beer!
            </p>
